# ToDo-List
a clean UI todo-List web application which checks,unchecks ,deletes and stores tasks in the web browser after refreshed or closed.It is different from your regular to do list beacause it uses a special  technique called eisenhower matrix which organises tasks based on importance and urgency.
but i have been stuck , The checkbox or the close button isn't appearing when a task is entered in the sections
